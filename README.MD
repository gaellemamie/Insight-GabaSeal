### 🧭 How It Works — System Flow

#### 🛠️ 1. System Initialization

- When the system is deployed, a **default admin account** is automatically created.
- This account manages system-wide settings and has access to all institution records.

#### 🏢 2. Adding Institutions

- Admin logs in and adds a new **institution** (e.g., school, hospital, company).
- Each institution must be verified by the admin.

#### 🔐 3. Institution Login

- Once verified, institutions can log into their dashboard to manage their own space.

#### 👥 4. Managing Teams

- Institutions can:
  - Add **Managers** (e.g., admin or signatory roles)



#### 📄 5. Uploading Documents

- Institutions can upload documents via a drag-and-drop interface.
- Each document includes metadata such as title, description, and associated collection.

#### ✍️ 6. Signing Documents

- Designated managers or signatories can sign documents digitally within the dashboard.

#### 📧 7. Sending to Users

- Documents and metadata can be emailed directly to users.
- Option to automate email upon signing.
- Documents can include QR code for scanning, which direct to insight for information about document

#### 📦 8. Bulk Signing

- Allows institutions to sign multiple documents in one go.
- Useful for mass communication, compliance docs, or student certificates.
